# SL configuration
config_id: 'test' # configuration id
n_sample: 0 # Number of datapoints to sample / downselect from raw data. Set to 0 to use full dataset.
n_training: 50 # Number of training rows to start SL process.
iterations: 5 # Number of SL iterations to perform.
trials: 3 # Number of trials (i.e. independent SL processes) to perform.
batch: 1 # Number of candidates to select at each SL iteration.
discovery_break_number: 0 # Number of candidates to find before halting SL process. If set to 0, SL will continue for n_iterations. 
poi: null # Point of interest. Index of point to be included in training set. Forces training set to include "point of interest". Typically set to `null`. 
holdout_fraction: 0.1 # Percent of dataset to holdout (test). 
targets: # Min and max of the target range, e.g. [90, 100] will target 10th decile materials.
